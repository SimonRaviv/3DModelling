3D Modeling of indoor environments using Kinect
===============================================


Files:
- camera.cpp: Interfacing with the Kinect.

- main.cpp:   Captures frames from Kinect.
	      User interface.

- ICPAlgorithm.cpp:  performing ICP algorithm and reconstructing process.

- PointCloudSet.cpp:  All pointclouds sets class.

- FileProcessing.cpp:  Writing ply format file to disk.

- 3DModellingH.h: The headers and typedefs of the project.

- CMakeLists.txt: Cmake file for the compilition.


Structure:

- Initialize Point Cloud with a random sample of the first frame.
- Initialize the global transformation with identity matrix.
- For each next frame:
	Extract a random sample from the frame for finding correspondences.
	For each ICP iteration:
		- Find correspondences
			- Set the previous frame points in KD-tree.
			- Get the closest correspondences.
		- Calculate SVD to find  the best transformation.
		- Update global transformation.
		- Rotate current point cloud.
	   	- Add transformed point cloud to the result (previous frame).
	
	Write the final result point cloud as ply file format in execution directory.
